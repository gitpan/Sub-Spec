=head1 VERSION

version 0.07

=head1 DESCRIPTION

XXX

=head2 Properties

=over 4

=item * per_import => BOOL

If true, this means that for each importer, Sub::Spec will construct a new
wrapper for the subroutine.

Retry and timeout are two such clauses.

=item * per_call => BOOL

If true, this means that in each subroutine call you can pass some value to
modify the clause behaviour: -CLAUSENAME => VALUE. The wrapper is able to act
upon the different clause arguments.

Retry and timeout are two such clauses. You can specify retry and timeout on a
per-call basis:

 search_files(root => '/', pattern => qr/^[abc]/, -timeout => 30);
 download_url(url => 'http://host/path', -timeout => 300, -retry => 4);
